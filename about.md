### How this site was built

This site was built using a collection of Open source services and tools that allowed for a complete CMS-like administration section targeting non-technical collaborators, automatically building and generating a static site.

Type Theme is a free and open-source theme for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), licensed under the MIT License, with complete [documentation](https://rohanchandra.github.io/project/type/) and much more information on [Github](http://github.com).
